Un día, mientras jugaba en el jardín, vio una ardilla corriendo cerca del árbol. A Manchas siempre le encantaba el juego de corretear ardillas, así que se puso muy emocionado y comenzó a perseguirla.\n\nLa ardilla saltó por la verja del jardín y se adentró en el bosque. Sin pensar en nada más, Manchas la siguió inmediatamente. Corrió y corrió, pero la ardilla era muy rápida y pronto se perdió de vista. Cuando Manchas finalmente se detuvo, se dio cuenta de que estaba en un lugar desconocido. Había perseguido a la ardilla tan lejos que ahora estaba perdido.",

Al verlo, todos se pusieron muy felices y corrieron a abrazarlo. Manchas también estaba muy contento de volver a casa. Prometió nunca más perseguir ardillas fuera del jardín. Aunque fue una aventura emocionante, definitivamente prefería estar en casa con su familia.\n\nY así, Manchas aprendió una gran lección ese día. Desde entonces, siempre se quedaba cerca de casa, disfrutando de sus juegos sin alejarse demasiado. Y cada vez que veía a una ardilla, simplemente la miraba correr y sonreía.",
